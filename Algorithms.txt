Sandstorm
0) Starting Position:
- On 3" mat
- Camera pointing away from drivers
- Color sensor pointing down
- Robot sides parallel to edges of mat

1) Get off the mat - Vikrant
- Keep going forward
- Camera view will tilt down, then become straight again
- Go another half second or so to get the bumper clear of the Hab Line

2) Attach panel to cargo ship - Ankith
- Drive to general area of hatch using camera
- Get color sensor to be above white tape
- Align robot w/ tape - zigzag algo (see tape go left, else go right)
- attach panel w/ robot arm (release suction cups)

General
1) Pick up hatch panel - Aditi
- Drive w/ eyes & camera to access port
- Align w/ color sensor
- Grab panel from access port
	- Use suction cups & robot arm

2) Place hatch panel - Same code from Sandstorm #2
- Use camera & eyes to go to general area of hatch
- Get color sensor to be above white tape
- Align robot w/ tape - zigzag algo (see tape go left, else go right)
- Attach panel w/ robot arm (release suction cups)

3) Place hatch panel on rocket ship higher level - Ankith
- Same as Algorithm #2 but use elevator control w/ rest of assembly

4) Pick up ball - Ishan
- Drive w/ eyes & camera to access port
- Align w/ color sensor
*Ball rolled onto "support bars"*
- Close upper support onto ball

5) Drop ball - Wilson
- Drive w/ eyes & camera to general area of drop
- Align w/ color sensor
- Open upper support
- Push ball out w/ piston

6) Drop ball in rocket ship higher level - Wilson
- Same as Algorithm #5, but use elevator control w/ rest of assembly

End
1) Go back to habitat - Vikrant
- Drive towards hab (use eyes & camera)
- Use eyes & camera to get back onto level 1 mat
